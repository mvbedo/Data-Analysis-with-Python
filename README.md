## Instructions

In this assignment, you are a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in residential real estate. You are tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. You will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and more. This is a template notebook; your job is to complete the ten questions provided. Hints to the questions are given.

As you complete this notebook, take and save screenshots of the final outputs of your solutions (e.g., final charts, tables, calculation results, etc.). These will need to be shared in the Peer Review section of the Final Project module.

## About the Dataset

This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, including Seattle, covering homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset was sourced from [this location](http://example.com) and has been slightly modified for the purposes of this course.

## Module 1: Importing Data

In this module, we imported the dataset and relevant libraries to begin the data analysis process. This included loading data into a pandas DataFrame and performing initial inspections to understand its structure.

## Module 2: Data Wrangling

Data wrangling involved cleaning the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy. We handled missing values, corrected data types, and standardized the format of various features. This step was crucial for preparing the data for analysis and modeling.

## Module 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

During this phase, we conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights within the data. We visualized distributions, relationships between features, and potential outliers, which helped in understanding the factors influencing house prices.

## Module 4: Model Development

In this module, we developed predictive models to estimate house prices based on the features in the dataset. We experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, to identify the best-performing model.

## Module 5: Model Evaluation and Refinement

The final module focused on evaluating and refining our predictive models. We used metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to assess model performance. We also fine-tuned hyperparameters and improved model accuracy through cross-validation and feature selection techniques.

## Estimated Time Needed

**75 minutes**
