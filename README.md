# Housing Price Prediction Project

## Objectives

1. **Import Data**: Load the dataset and libraries required for analysis.
2. **Data Wrangling**: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis by addressing missing values and correcting data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze and visualize the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships between features.
4. **Model Development**: Develop predictive models to estimate housing prices using various machine learning algorithms.
5. **Model Evaluation and Refinement**: Evaluate model performance and refine the models to improve accuracy.

## Instructions

In this assignment, I acted as a Data Analyst for a Real Estate Investment Trust interested in investing in residential real estate. My task was to predict housing prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of floors. The assignment involved completing a series of steps and answering ten specific questions. Additionally, I took screenshots of the final outputs, including charts, tables, and results, which are shared in the Peer Review section of the Final Project module.

## About the Dataset

The dataset I used contains housing sale prices for King County, including Seattle. It includes sales data from May 2014 to May 2015 and was sourced from [this location]([http://example.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)). The dataset was slightly modified for the course.

## Module 1: Importing Data

In this module, I imported the dataset along with the necessary libraries. This involved loading the data into a pandas DataFrame and performing an initial examination to understand its structure and content.

## Module 2: Data Wrangling

Data wrangling was a critical step where I cleaned and prepared the dataset. I addressed missing values, corrected data types, and standardized the format of various features to ensure the data was ready for analysis and modeling.

## Module 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, I examined the dataset to uncover patterns and insights. I used visualization techniques to analyze distributions, relationships between features, and identify any outliers. This analysis helped me understand the factors influencing house prices.

## Module 4: Model Development

In this module, I developed predictive models to estimate house prices. I experimented with several machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, to determine which model performed best for this dataset.

## Module 5: Model Evaluation and Refinement

The final module focused on evaluating and refining the predictive models. I assessed model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. I also fine-tuned hyperparameters and used cross-validation to enhance model accuracy and robustness.

## Key Learnings

Through this project, I learned:

- The importance of meticulous data cleaning and preparation to ensure accurate modeling results.
- Techniques for exploratory data analysis and how to visualize data to uncover insights.
- The process of developing, evaluating, and refining machine learning models.
- Practical skills in working with real-world datasets and solving data-driven problems.

This project provided me with a comprehensive understanding of data analysis and predictive modeling, equipping me with essential skills for a career in data analytics.
